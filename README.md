# Explore UK Crime Data with Pandas and GeoPandas

In this workshop you will learn how to expand your Python skills to geospatial data. Pandas is one of the main Python libraries for manipulating and analysing structured data and one of the first things to learn if you want to get started with data science. GeoPandas is an extension to Pandas that makes working with geospatial data in Python easier.Â 

This workshop is an introduction to Pandas and GeoPandas where you will learn about:
- Jupyter notebooks
- Pandas and GeoPandas data structures
- Transforming and exploring geospatial data
- Visualising data with charts and maps

During the workshop we will analyse UK Crime Data with Pandas and GeoPandas in a Jupyter notebook. We first will look at the properties of geospatial data and explore the different commands. After you have learned the basics we will go through some exercises analysing UK Crime Data to explore patterns and trends and create maps of crime rates in London.

# Setup 

You can run the Jupyter notebooks in any environment of your choice. Below are the environments that will be supported during the workshop, but feel free to use another one if you are comfortable with setting up a costom environment.

You can either run the notebooks locally, or use Watson Studio. Watson Studio runs in the Cloud, so for this option you do not have to install anything locally on your own computer, but still can go back to the notebooks later. 

For all options please download the [workshop repository](https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/foss4g-geopandas).

Use one of the below options:
* Download the repo by clicking the green download button
* Use Github Desktop 
* Open a terminal and go to the directory where you want to work and type the following: 

`git clone https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/foss4g-geopandas.git`
